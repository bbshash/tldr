# mkdir and rmdir

> The command mkdir is used to create a directory, and rmdir or rm - r can both be used to delete a directory.

- Create a directory titled directory name:

`mkdir directory_name`

- Using the ls command you can list the directory you have made:

`ls`

- You can then use rmdir to delete the directory if the directory is empty:

`rmdir directory_name`

- If the directory is not empty you can use rm -r.  NOTE, this will permanently delete all of your files in this directory as well as the directory itself:

`rm -r directory_name`
