# mkdir and rmdir

> mkdir is used to create a directory, and rmdir is used to delete a directory

- Create a directory titled directory name:

`mkdir directory_name`

- Using the ls command you can list the directory you have made:

`ls`

- You can then use rmdir to delete the directory if the directory is empty:

`rmdir directory_name`

- If the directory is not empty you can use:

`rm -r directory_name`

- NOTE, this will permanently delete all of your files in this directory as well as the directory itself.
